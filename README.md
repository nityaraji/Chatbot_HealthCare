# Chatbot_HealthCare
Chatbot for healthcare
Take a moment and think. If you were to read about do's and don’ts during some uncritical health condition, where would you go to find the information?
Of course, you will straight up Google the information or visit a healthcare website. 
If we have an online library full of useful information, it could help a large group of people. Professional multimedia and interactive libraries have more important takeaways than printed information.
(Multimedia is a form of communication that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, or video into a single interactive presentation, in contrast to traditional mass media, such as printed material or audio recordings, which features little to no interaction between users)
Using multimedia for health education can promote active learning and also generate more user interest.
Therefore, it’s important to provide information on healthcare in a way that it’s easily understood by the end-users.
We can integrate useful multimedia and animation into our healthcare apps to educate a large population.


Here are the basic steps that we have followed to create a healthcare chatbot using PHP, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL:
Planing of chat bot: Before start coding, we planed our chatbot by identifying the problems it will solve and the services it will offer. 
Designing the user interface: Using PHP and CSS designed the user interface of chatbot. The interface should be easy to navigate and visually appealing.
Chatbot logic: Used JavaScript to code the logic of chat bot. The chatbot should be able to understand natural language, process user input, and provide relevant responses.
Integrating a natural language processing (NLP) service: To enhance the performance of chat bot, we integrated an NLP service Dialogflow.
Connecting to a database: Used PHP to connect chatbot to a database that stores user information and chat history.

Now Coming to securing the chatbot that we have made. As of now we haven't implemented any feature that will protect our users data from cyber threats as we are new to this platform.However, we have planned to implement source authentication like strong passwords.

We can also include encryption of sensitive data such as health info which protects unauthorized access to the data even if the chatbot is compromised. we can implement this by open SSL.
There is more but That is it for now 
This is all about our healthcare chatbot. Thank you for giving us this wonderful opportunity to implement our thoughts.
